# QuickSort
Sorts an array of integers using Divide and Conquer.
Comments in the source code explained every tought process applied in order the achieve the result.
I studied the algoritmh from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ and they present it as written in the CLRS book
They have a video uploaded that could help begginers visualize the way quicksort works under the hood
